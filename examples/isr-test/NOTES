Timer-related things run at NORDIC_DEFAULT_IRQ_PRIORITY, i.e. 1, while GPIO is
configured to run at priority 5. So GPIO can be preempted by timers.

This is all configured in the device tree.

Relevant paths:

- dts/arm/nordic/nrf_common.dtsi: where default irq priority is set.
- dts/arm/nordic/nrf52840.dtsi: where timer and gpio priorities are set.

We can probably assume that ISRs cannot preempt themselves.

QUES: can we rely on this? Considered asking in Slack, but deleted message
because it wasn't a very concrete question. Better to implement something first.

TODO: figure out how to configure the priorities in the device overlay. In
particular, what happens if we invert the priorities?

QUES: explore workqueue vs msgq. Why use the workqueue over the msgq?

QUES: what are ZLIs? Seems to promise better performance, but how much better?
Are they easy to configure?

TODO: implement alarm chaining to support setting 64-bit alarms.
